# Documentation Section

The first section of a Scroll macro document is an optional section for documenting a macro.
This section always come first within a document and looks like this:

```
> This is documentation on my super cool macro!
> Roll an attack for 1d20 + strength modifier
```

Each line in the document section must start with the `>` character and can be followed by any other character.
An example of this fact looks like this:

```
> I ‚ù§ Macros!
```

The document section can be as long as you like, as long as this format is followed.
