# The Scroll Macro Language

Worp uses a custom text processing and templating language called Scroll for evaluating and running macros within the table top environment.
It is one of the core components of the Worp Virtual Table Top and acts as a method of automating the various actions performed in a game.
It is targeted towards various groups of individuals interacting with Worp over the course of developing and play a table top game.

## Who Scroll is For

Scroll targets a wide audience of Game Masters, players, module and map designers, and people designing their own table top games and systems.

### Game Masters

Game Masters will find themselves frequently interacting with and possibly writing Scroll macros over the course of a game.
They're made available through various context menus and hot bars associated with the tokens on the field.
Game Masters can also access and run macros that aren't related to any specific token.
Scroll allows Game Masters to quickly execute actions they need to perform throughout the course of a game, such as actions performed by NPCs, monsters, environmental interactions, etc.

### Players
Players will frequently use Scroll macros from their own tokens to perform actions throughout the course of a game.
They're made available through various context menus and hot bars associated with the tokens owned by a player.

### Module and Map Designers
Module and map designers will likely find themselves writing Scroll macros to give their world life and to provide actions for Game Masters and players to interact with.

### Table Top Designers
Table Top Designers will leverage Scroll to model their table top system by using it to encode all the rules and actions of their system as macros.
In this case Scroll will be frequently used to create the basic templates needed for the other groups mentioned above to play a table top system.
